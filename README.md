# Kahoot-autoplay

- ## Description

This tool uses selenium to get kahoot answers either from a link or the name of the kahoot, then uses the answers to play the kahoot for you!

- ## How to use

Run the autoplay.py file and follow the instructions.

- ## Why does it need my kahoot login?

It needs your kahoot login to be able to access the answers for a kahoot, it will then save your login to a .ini file so that you wont have to retype it every  time you want to use the application.

- ## Warning

- If your internet is slow you can try changing the sleep function at line 87.

- This only works on the quiz and true/false gamemode at the moment.

- # Requirements
